# The Witch's Cottage

A small text adventure game where you are a toy that gained sentience. A character is born by the choices made and the boons obtained. Fight the nightmares of the night and protect the town of "Pizzzzaa" from a flying broccoli invation. Or defeat the momusaurous rex at the crust of a dry pudding dessert. The toy is yours to control, but the universe belongs to someone else.
